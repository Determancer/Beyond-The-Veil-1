# Welcome to Beyond the Veil!

A Minecraft Mod inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as other works based on the author.

It is Work-In-Progress, and I am yet unsure whether it'll ever see the light of day. I am currently enjoying its development quite a lot though.

I occasionally post sneak peeks on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzjExgDSkPIOTaRLOK97x1Q).

As of now, the mod requires Thaumcraft to work, as in its early stages I made BTV use TC's research and aspect system, despite being different from it in style and mechanics. I have, however, decided to remove that dependency before release, remaking the research system. It will still require Baubles, though.

Some of the older code here is shoddily written, due to this being my first foray into Minecraft Modding. It got better as I went though.
