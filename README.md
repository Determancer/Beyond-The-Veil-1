# Welcome to Beyond the Veil!

A Minecraft Mod inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as other works based on the author.

It is Work-In-Progress, and is about to reach an alpha testing phase.

I occasionally post sneak peeks on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzjExgDSkPIOTaRLOK97x1Q).

The mod is 1.12.2 only, and I don't think I'll update to newer MC versions any time soon. It also requires Baubles.

Some of the older code here is shoddily written, due to this being my first foray into Minecraft Modding. It got better as I went though.
