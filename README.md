Welcome to
Beyond the Veil!

A Minecraft Mod inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as other works based on the author.

It is EXTREMELY Work-In-Progress, and I am yet unsure whether it'll ever see the light of day. I am currently enjoying its development quite a lot though.

You can get a few sneak peeks on this unlisted playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxGcj3Q_sXcGVVId2I9johb_JUah_fDm1

The mod requires Thaumcraft to work, as it utilizes its research, warp and aspect systems, despite being quite different from it in style and mechanics.

A good chunk of the code here is shoddily written, due to this being my first foray into Minecraft Modding. It got better as I went, but don't read too much into it if your goal is to learn modding..

I'll add further documentation as I go.
