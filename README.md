Welcome to
Beyond the Veil!

A Minecraft Mod inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as other works based on the author.

It is Work-In-Progress, and I am yet unsure whether it'll ever see the light of day. I am currently enjoying its development quite a lot though.

I occasionally post sneak peeks on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzjExgDSkPIOTaRLOK97x1Q

The mod (currently) requires Thaumcraft to work, as it utilizes its research and some of its aspect system, despite being quite different from it in style and mechanics.

Some of the older code here is shoddily written, due to this being my first foray into Minecraft Modding. It got better as I went though.
